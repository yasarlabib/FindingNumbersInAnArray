# FindingNumbersInAnArray
This program will allow the user to enter in numbers and whether a number is inside of the array or not.
The user may choose the size of the array.
The user inputs all of the values, loading up the array.
The program prints out the unsorted array.
The program uses bubble sort to sort the data and puts it in ascending order.
The program will then print out the numbers in ascending order.
The user is asked what number they are looking for, which then that number is equal to the target number.
The user may choose to search for the number using linear search or binary search. 
If the number is inside of the data set, then the program returns "found", and returns "not found" otherwise.
